   * 31.05.09: The project is started.

=Game Overview=

==Game Concept==

As you start up the game, a slick menu appears, giving a little impression on how the general atmosphere and graphics in the game is. Soon you're welcomed into the protagonists amazing 2D world. A nice little intro sequence gives you a kickstart into the story, and the game itself, and then glides over, almost unnoticeable, giving you control over the protagonist. Your adventure starts here. 

Soon you notice that the black surface you walk on is special. If you stand still for too long, the black, goo-like surface will engulf you, leading to death. But at the same time, you'll also notice that this surface is the only surface you may walk on. In other words, its both the source of life, and death. 

Further on in the game, you'll meet exciting monsters and bosses to fight, in an incredible, fast-paced adventure in a unique fantasy world.

_Additional note; The main aspect of the game will be the visuals, and the graphics, as we dont expect to get too advanced programmers etc. Allthough, simpleness can always result in epicness!_

==Genre==

Side-scrolling Platformer

==Target Audience==

The targeted audience will be everyone from the age of 6 and up.

==Game Flow Summary==

The player moves to the left or the right of a level. It'll be a "regular 2D-sidescrolling-Game" Game flow, where you have to get to the other side of the level to complete it (apart from the boss fights in some). On level complete, the player are presented with a map, where he may choose which level to go to next. The interface flow will be quick and responsive, and minimalistic - easy to understand.

==Look and Feel==

The Main visual style of the game will be the "Vector'ish" design. It will be beautiful and compelling. Solid colors, with a thin black outline, in contrast with the main characters white outlines.

==Project Scope==

The game will consist of 10 levels in total, with a large variety of themes. Each level will be one Act, story-wise, and it will all be spread among 2 islands (1 small, 1 big).


===Number of Levels===

10 levels in total.

===Number of NPCs===

10 different kinds of NPCs, and 3 Bosses.

===Number of powerups===

|| 1 || HP Up ||
|| 2 || - ||
|| 3 || - ||

=Gameplay and Mechanics=

The general gameplay will be familiar for most; classic 2D. Though it has its unique aspects.

==Gameplay==

Throughout the game, the player must always be aware of certain things. The basic thing is ofcourse that he must get from the starting position, to the opposite side of the level, or the assigned finishing spot. Other than that, theres the vital black surface the player walks on. He can only walk on this, but if he stays on it for too long, it will drag the player down, leading to death - meaning, the player must always be on the move.

===Game Progression===

The player reaches progression as he clears levels and kills bosses. Additional bonuses may also be unlocked via exploring.

===Mission/Challenge structure===

The challenge structure in the game will be quite simple. As mentioned before, its alot like the old NES sidescrollers and other 2D-sidescrolling games; get to the other side (or in some cases, on the top of the level, or below the surface, in other words, another specified finishing line). 

===Objectives===

The main objectives in the game is to simply finish the level, and get to the next one. Side objectives, not mandatory though, is to collect rare, hidden items.

===Play Flow===

The game will flow nicely for the player, with smooth animations and a lagfree enviroment. The game itself _may_ be fast-paced, as the ground could engulf the player over time if too long breaks are taken. This will also add hectic fights versus mobs and bosses.
