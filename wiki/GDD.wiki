=Game Overview=

==Game Concept==

As you start up the game, a slick menu appears, giving a little impression on how the general atmosphere and graphics in the game is. Soon you're welcomed into the protagonists amazing 2D world. A nice little intro sequence gives you a kickstart into the story, and the game itself, and then glides over, almost unnoticeable, giving you control over the protagonist. Your adventure starts here. 

Soon you notice that the black surface you walk on is special. If you stand still for too long, the black, goo-like surface will engulf you, leading to death. But at the same time, you'll also notice that this surface is the only surface you may walk on. In other words, its both the source of life, and death. 

Further on in the game, you'll meet exciting monsters and bosses to fight, in an incredible, fast-paced adventure in a unique fantasy world.

==Genre==

Side-scrolling Platformer

==Target Audience==

The targeted audience will be people in all ages. 

==Game Flow Summary==

The player moves to the left (back) or the right (forward). It'll be a "regular 2D-Game" Game flow, where you have to get to the other side of the level. On level complete, the player are presented with a map, where he may choose which level to go to next. The interface flow will be quick and responsive, and minimalistic - easy to understand.

==Look and Feel==

The Main visual style of the game will be the "Vector'ish" design. It will be beautiful and compelling. Solid colors, with a thin black outline, in contrast with the main characters white outlines.

==Project Scope==

The game will consist of 10 levels in total, with a large variety of themes. Each level will be one Act, story-wise, and it will all be spread among 4 islands (3 small, one big).

===Play Flow===

==Mechanics==
